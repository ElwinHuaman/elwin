Eurostars funded project WordLift New Generation aims at the construction of the most SEO-friendly structured linked data in a simple way. Its objective is to expand WordLiftâ€™s market reach by creating a new platform to deliver the features offered today to WordPress users to any websites regardless of the CMS. We plan to improve the backend's performance enabling enrichment and querying of RDF graphs with semantic similarity indices and full-text search allowing clients of WordLift and Redlink to: implement semantic search and content recommendations on their website; integrate with personal digital assistants such as Amazon Alexa.

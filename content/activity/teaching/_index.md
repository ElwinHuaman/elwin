      text: 'Throughout my career as a E-learning developer and teacher, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of course design and content, grading policy, and course delivery. Furthermore, my background includes working with students of different nationalities and age ranges, which varies from bachelor students, master students, professors, and general (non-technical) participants. Likewise, my teaching experience includes the design and delivery of online and offline courses.'

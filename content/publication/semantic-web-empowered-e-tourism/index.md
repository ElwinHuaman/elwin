abstract: "Smart speakers such as Alexa and later Google Home have introduced
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) into millions, soon to be billions of households,
  making AI an everyday experience. These new communication channels present a
  new challenge for successful e-Marketing and e-Commerce providers. Data,
  content, and services are becoming semantically annotated, allowing software
  agents, so-called bots, to search through the web and understand its content.
  Nowadays, users typically consult their bot to find, aggregate, and
  personalize information and to reserve, book, or buy products and services. As
  a consequence, it is becoming increasingly important for touristic providers
  of information, products, and services to be prominently visible in these new
  online channels to ensure their future economic maturity. In our chapter, we
  survey the methods and tools helping to achieve these goals. The core aim is
  the development and application of machine-processable (semantic) annotations
  of content, data, and services, as well as their aggregation in large
  Knowledge Graphs. It is only through these methods bots are able to answer a
  question in a knowledgeable way and organize a useful dialogue (Knowledge
  Graphs in Use A significantly extended and generalized version of this article
  will appear as D. Fensel, K. Angele, E. Huaman, E. Kärle, O. Panasiuk, U.
  Şimşek, I. Toma, J. Umbrich, and A. Wahler: Knowledge Graphs: Methodology,
  Tools and Selected Use Cases. Springer Nature, 2020.)."

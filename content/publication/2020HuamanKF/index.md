abstract: "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have shown to be an important asset of large companies like Google and Microsoft. KGs play an important role in providing structured and semantically rich information, making them available to people and machines, and supplying accurate, correct and reliable knowledge. To do so a critical task is knowledge validation, which measures whether statements from KGs are semantically correct and correspond to the so-called real world. In this paper, we provide an overview and review of the state-of-the-art approaches, methods and tools on knowledge validation for KGs, as well as an evaluation of them. As a result, we demonstrate a lack of reproducibility of tools results, give insights, and state our future research direction."

abstract: "Over the last decade, the Web has increasingly become a space of language and knowledge representation. However, it is only true for well-spread languages and well-established communities, while minority communities and their resources received less attention. In this paper, we propose QICHWABASE to support the harmonization process of the Quechua language and knowledge, and its community. For doing it, we adopt methods and tools that could become a game changer in favour of Quechua communities around the world. We conclude that the methodology and tools adopted on building QICHWABASE, which is a Wikibase instance, could enhance the presence of minorities on the Web."

# Supporting minority languages and Wikimedia's global community
Contemporary humans have developed 7,167 natural languages, 331 have secured a Wikipedia which then becomes de facto central online hub for those communities. 95.4% (~6,800) of the linguistic diversity isnt supported by Wikimedia while half (3,500) are expected to disappear in coming 70 years.

## How can wikimedians help knowledgeable communities to promote their language?
- Landscape of lesser resource languages and Wikimedia
- Positive experiences
- Challenging experiences
- Which solutions, who can help within Wikimedia ?
- Can incoming technologies help ?

These questions will be discussed by experienced language documentation, conservation, and revitalization panel members.

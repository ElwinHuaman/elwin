# My first step

I am a quechua, from Peru, and preserving knowledge was always a challenge in my family. My mother [Ninfa]() had to travel long distances to alphabetize quechua communities, my father [Luis]() is a quechua singer in my town. And, I personally was involved in the process of preserving knowledge through literacy, songs, poems, meetings, and being in contact with quechua communities.

I am an indigenous Quechua from Peru, and as a proud Quechuan, my aim to empower and support endangered-language communities in reclaiming our rights and presence on and off the Web, has always driven my academic, professional, and personal journey.

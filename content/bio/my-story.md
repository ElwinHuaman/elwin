## My first step

I am a quechua, from Peru, and preserving knowledge was always a challenge in my family. My mother [Ninfa]() had to travel long distances to alphabetize quechua communities, my father [Luis]() is a quechua singer in my town. And, I personally was involved in the process of preserving knowledge through literacy, songs, poems, meetings, and being in contact with quechua communities.

I am an indigenous Quechua from Peru, and as a proud Quechuan, my aim to empower and support endangered-language communities in reclaiming our rights and presence on and off the Web, has always driven my academic, professional, and personal journey. 

My journey in language work began at the age of 6, when I accompanied and helped my mother Ninfa in her work to literate Quechua communities in Nuñoa (4000 masl), Peru. At the age of 17, I started my bachelor’s studies in Computer Science (Peru), with the intention of learning skills, methods, and tools to preserve my knowledge and language. Later, at the age of 23, I started my master's studies in Digital Information Systems (Spain), where I specialized in digital preservation, repositories, content management systems, and librarian tasks, such as, organization, annotation, and representation of resources (documents, videos, websites, etc). To deepen my expertise, at the age of 27, I completed a master’s degree in Web Engineering (Spain), focusing on the curation of human knowledge stored on the web, and how to make it accessible and inclusive to all. Currently, as a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics and Media Studies at the University of Innsbruck (Austria), I have deepened my skills in lecturing, moderating online spaces, tutoring students, and researching. I have co-authored the book: Knowledge Graphs: Methodology, Tools and Selected Use Cases.
